# FHIR Example

This is part of a set of pages on introduction to computer science. https://github.com/cmcntsh/IntroCompSci2021_topics

## Exercises

* (Still a work in progress, not really ready) Build a FHIR application https://github.com/cmcntsh/exerAsymmetrikFhirAppStarter

## Assigned Instructional Material

* See assignment links.

## Optional Material

* Some more FHIR resources (Some great finds by previous students.)
  * https://www.hl7.org/fhir/modules.html (Links to an external site.) 
  * REDCap & FHIR: https://www.hcinnovationgroup.com/interoperability-hie/fast-healthcare-interoperability-resources-fhir/article/21111013/hey-your-redcap-is-on-fhir (Links to an external site.) 
  * FHIR is definitely critical. Every HealthTech company will need to deal with it at some point. We started working with FHIR in 2017, and it is now relevant to every business unit. There is a great resource for learning and experimenting with FHIR on GCP in the Healthcare API. Find tutorials here: https://cloud.google.com/healthcare-api/docs/how-tos/fhir-resources (Links to an external site.)  (Links to an external site.)
  * You can create a free account and get immediate access. There is a $300 credit for new users. You don need to enter a credit card, but it will never be charged unless you opt to go beyond your limit. 
  * Once you create the GCP account at cloud.google.com, go to your console in the top right corner.
  * In the console, access the healthcare FHIR viewer through the left menu tree
  * You will need to enable the Cloud Healthcare API
  * You can then access samples and practice with code available on GitHub https://www.capminds.com/blog/hl7-vs-fhir-whats-the-real-difference/
* Next steps: Keep your eye on emerging technology. (Here's some I have my eye on.)
  * Julia: https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/10/the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-the-julia-programming-language/ (Links to an external site.)
